			description = Eve is certainly the most chocolatiest object in the solar system. It’s one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very thick atmosphere. It is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the brown sea, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures. Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?
